
INTRODUCTION

	Bot whose porpouse of life is to predict within 15 minutes wheter or not a post will get to the 0.1 hottest posts of its subreddit.


READER

	This module consist of 2 principal components: one that imports and follows the newest reddit submissions; another that imports the
	hottest posts of the subreddit in consideration.


WRITER

	The writer is basically a model built on R that predicts if a post will get to hot. If it predict that a certain post will indeed
	burn, it will take a screenshot of the reddit url and send it to the indicated mail. It will use Selenium.
	
	It will import the info readed by the reader and will look for information of the users who posted the information
	
MAKE IT WORK

	Due to the high volume of post made in a day we use 24 reddit accounts. 3 accounts are for checking what is new in the analyzed subreddits;
	2 are for checking what gets hot or top in those subreddits; 18 are for keep track of the post that arrive to new; 1 that predicts wether or not a post
	get to hot.
	
	You will need to add the reddit accounts in the following files:
		- "reader/executers/linuxExecReaders"
		- "reader/executers/linuxExec"
		- "writer/writeWhileExec"
		
	You will also have to give a from and a to gmails in and the password of the sender"writer/bot.py   -  line 25,26,52"
	
	In case you dont want to send any email but would like to have the screenshot you can change the last argument
	of the call to bot.py in "writer/writeWhileExec" to something different to 1.
